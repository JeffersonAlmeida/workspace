<h1>Test Suite Format </h1>
<p>The generated Test Suite format follows the TestCentral format. A test case is composed 
by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Use Cases</b> field, which lists all use cases related to the test
    case.</li>
  <li>The <b>Requirements</b> field, which is filled with all requirements covered by the test case.</li>
  <li>The <b>Setup</b> field, which is filled with the setup information from
    the use cases (see
  the <a href="UseCaseDocStructure.htm">use case structure</a>).</li>
  <li>The<b> Initial Conditions</b> field, which is filled with all system states covered by the test case.</li>
  <li>The <b>Procedure</b> field, which is a sequence of user actions from
  the use cases (see the <a href="UseCaseDocStructure.htm">use case structure</a>).</li>
  <li>The <b>Expected Results</b> field, which is the sequence of system
  responses for its corresponding actions (see
  the <a href="UseCaseDocStructure.htm">use case structure</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are other test case fields in the example above.
However, the content of those fields is not generated, or are generated with a
default text.</p>
