<h1>Errors and Warnings in Documents </h1>
<p>In TaRGeT, the document defects are classified in errors <img border="0" src="Images/error.gif" width="16" height="16">
and warnings <img border="0" src="Images/warning.gif" width="16" height="16">. If the
project contains any type of error, TaRGeT will not generate tests. On the other
hand, TaRGeT generates tests from projects that contain warnings.&nbsp;</p>
<p> There are two
kinds of errors in TaRGeT. They are listed below:.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple error</b> - The simple errors do not compromise  the processing of the document. They are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Duplicated Step Id Error - </b> Occurs when more than one step, inside the same use
        case, presents the same ID.</li>
      <li><b>Empty Field Error</b> - Occurs when   the step id, action or response are empty. If
        a use case has more than one error, only one will be displayed
        in the <b>Errors</b> view.</li>
      <li><b>Invalid Step Id Reference Error</b> - Occurs when the document (in the
      <b>To Steps</b> and/or <b>From Steps</b> fields) has an invalid step reference.</li>
      <li><b>Invalid To/From Steps Error</b> -&nbsp; Occurs when To/From Steps
        are not in the Step ID format.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Fatal error</b> - The fatal errors compromise the processing of the document,
   so its contents will not be displayed in the <a href="TaRGeTWorkspace.htm">TaRGeT Workspace</a>. They are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Unable To Load Document Error - </b> Occurs when the document is not 
      a Microsoft Word, or it is Microsoft Word but does not have attached XML, or it is Microsoft Word but the XML is not 
      according to the pre-defined template. </li>
      <li><b>Duplicate Use Case Id Error - </b> Occurs when there is more than one 
      use case, inside the same Feature, with the same ID.</li>
      <li><b>Empty Use Case Id Error - </b> Occurs when one 
      use case ID 
      is empty.</li>
      <li><b>Invalid Use Case ID Error -</b> Occurs when the Use Case ID field
        is composed by symbols or &quot;numbers_letters&quot;, e.g.
        &quot;01_UC&quot;.</li>
      <li><b>Duplicate Feature Id Inside Document Error</b> -  Occurs when there 
      is more than one
      feature,
      inside the same document, with equal IDs. </li>
      <li><b>Empty Feature Id Inside Document Error</b> -  Occurs when the
        feature ID 
      is empty. </li>
      <li><b>Invalid Feature ID Error </b>- Occurs when there are any content
        different from numbers in the Feature ID. </li>
      <li><b>Empty To/From Steps Error </b>- Occurs when From Step ot To Step
        fields are empty. </li>
      <li><b>Invalid Step ID Error </b>- Occurs when it is not in the Step ID
        format (Numbers + Uppercase Letters) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the warnings, TaRGeT consider the follow ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Features With Same Id But Different Names</b> - TaRGeT accepts two or
    more features with same Id that are placed in different documents. Actually,
    TaRGeT considers the features as only one. Although the features have the
    same Id, they may have different names, which sounds mistaken in the TaRGeT
    environment. So, the user is notified with a warning message. </li>
</ul>
